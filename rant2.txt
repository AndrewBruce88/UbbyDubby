To whom it may concern:

You sir are a louse; a lark; a silly git whose name does not need bear repeating on any such radio station as this. A respectable radio station is an important asset to a world in strife. And I do not need to remind that we are in such a world.

Please learn to do better in the future.

Yours truly,

Albert Einstein
