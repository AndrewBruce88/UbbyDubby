# UbbyDubby

2021-12-09

A new project defined by myself as a quick exercise in text manipulation, file reading / writing, and
a bit of fun.

This script takes in a local file, and turns the contents into a made-up pig-latin-esque language called
"ubby dubby", the correct translation of "This is not pig latin" being "Thubb-is ubb-is nubb-ot pubb-ig
lubb-atubb-in". It gets very ridiculous when applied to a longer word like "ridiculous": "rubb-idubb-icubb-ulubb-ous"

It saves the new content into a new file with " in ubby dubby" appended to the filename.

This was quick and took about 4 hours of work to get working to this level.

Example input and output files are included in this folder as well.
